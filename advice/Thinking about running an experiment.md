# Thinking about running an experiment?

Here are some questions to guide you. Before meeting to discuss your experiment, you should try to answer as many of these questions as possible in a research design memo.

- What is your “big picture” theoretical question? You should think about this as the first few sentences of an abstract to the paper produced from this research.
- How do you plan on operationalizing this in your experiment? 
- What is the treatment manipulating? How is this connected to your bigger theoretical picture?
- What is your outcome measuring? How is this connected to your bigger theoretical picture?
- What will readers learn if your experiment turns out positive, negative, or null? Will the experiment be interesting and important regardless of how it turns out?
- What will your sample be? How do you plan on recruiting them for treatment delivery and outcome measurement?
- What will a critical reviewer think of your theoretical contribution? What can you do at this point to avoid these criticisms?
- What will a critical reviewer think of your experimental design? What can you do at this point to avoid these criticisms?
- Do you have funding for this plan? If not, have you identified sources of funding?
- Have you done a power calculation for planning your sample size and budget? How do you justify your assumptions?

*[If survey experiment]*

- Is a field experiment answering your big picture question feasible? If not, why not? Say more than just a lack of funding.
- Would this research be more interesting if conducted as a field experiment than a survey experiment? Why or why not?

# Thinking about running an experiment?

Here are some questions to guide you. Before meeting to discuss your experiment, you should answer these questions. You can answer them here: https://goo.gl/forms/daRVS2pIgigpHY4H2

- What is your “big picture” theoretical question? You should think about this as the first few sentences of an abstract to the paper produced from this research.
    - Sometimes people say their question is “problem driven.” In academic work, a problem is something we cannot explain given existing work, more akin to a puzzle. Ask yourself, what is the puzzle or question we can't answer now, and why is answering it important?
- How do you plan on operationalizing this theoretical question in your experiment? 
- What has prior work in this domain found? How is this experiment an advance over the prior work?
- What will a critical reviewer think of your theoretical contribution? What can you do at this point to avoid these criticisms?
- What is your proposed treatment? What does it manipulate and how does this connect to your bigger theoretical picture? Relatedly, how do you know that it is manipulating only that mechanism and not others?
    - The assumption that a treatment works by perturbing one theoretical construct but not any other is the exclusion restriction. You should be prepared to explain how your treatment will be perceived and why you are sure that is the correct interpretation.
- What is your outcome measuring? How is this connected to your bigger theoretical picture?
- What will a critical reviewer think of your experimental design? What can you do at this point to avoid these criticisms?
- What will readers learn if your experiment turns out positive, negative, or null? Will the experiment be interesting and important regardless of how it turns out? Write distinct abstracts for how you would publish these results under each scenario.
    - Who is the audience? Why will they care?
      - What is the problem being addressed by this study?
      - What is the main result? Here we show...
      - How does the result add to or contrast with existing knowledge?
      - How does the result fit into a more general context?
- What will your sample be? How do you plan on recruiting them for treatment delivery and outcome measurement?
- Do you have funding for this plan? If not, have you identified sources of funding?
- Have you done a power calculation for planning your sample size and budget? How do you justify your assumptions?

*[If survey experiment]*

- Is a field experiment answering your big picture question feasible? If not, why not? Say more than just a lack of funding.
- Would this research be more interesting if conducted as a field experiment than a survey experiment? Why or why not?
